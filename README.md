# Master's thesis - Lucía Hurtado de Mendoza García de La-Chica

> Research analysis done on the determination of common transcriptomic alterations in neuromuscular diseases using the tool ExpHunter Suite. 

## INTRODUCTION
This repository is part of my master's thesis. In it, you will find the code developed for the analysis within the work, as well as the expression count tables that were used in the ExpHunter Suite analysis and the reports returned by the tool. 
After obtaining the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for each dataset studied, DMD_hiseq4k_single, DMD_nextseq500_paired, DMD_nextseq500_single and ALS_hiseq4k_paired (refer to the manuscript for details in each dataset), we searched for common prevalent and possible DEGs in all datasets. 

## REQUIREMENTS
* R version 4
* ExpHunter Suite package (https://github.com/seoanezonjic/ExpHunterSuite)
* Packages used throughout the scripts from CRAN or Bioconductor. 

## TABLE OF CONTENTS
* [Code](./Code) : appropiately commented scripts. 
* [Count tables](./Count_tables): one for each dataset, as well as a file with the correct labels per sample.
* [Reports](./Reports): output after executing the ExpHunter Suite analysis.
